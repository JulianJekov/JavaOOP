# 📚 Java OOP - Юни 2023

## 🎓 Course Overview
The **Java OOP** course is designed to teach the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Participants will learn how to work with classes and objects, use object-oriented modeling, and build class hierarchies. The course covers fundamental OOP concepts such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Additionally, it introduces commonly used design patterns, unit testing, Test Driven Development (TDD), and the use of reflection.

## 🗂️ Topics Covered
- **Working with Abstraction**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**

- **Polymorphism**
- **SOLID Principles**
- **Reflection and Annotation**
- **Exceptions and Error Handling**
- **Debugging Techniques**
- **Unit Testing**
- **Test Driven Development (TDD)**
- **Design Patterns**
